## Fred Hutch Data Science Lab Code of Conduct

The Fred Hutch Data Science Lab (FH DaSL) is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all group members, including leadership, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, Basecamp, and Twitter.

FH DaSL group members violating these rules will be referred to TBD and will no longer be allowed to participate in FH DaSL activities. 

## All FH DaSL Group members agree to:

* __Be considerate__ in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.
* __Be respectful__ Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. FH DaSL members should be respectful with other members in the group as well as members outside of the FH DaSL Group.
* __Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech__ Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Jeff Leek or a member of the FH DaSL Team (Amy Paguirigan or Sean Kross)
* __Take care of each other__ Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert a faculty member, staff member, or appropriate authorities if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
